## 📌 Project Overview  
This project focuses on analyzing **Blinkit grocery sales data** to uncover insights into sales, customer preferences, and outlet performance. Using **Python and Jupyter Notebook**, we explored multiple KPIs and built visualizations to support data-driven decision-making.  

Blinkit operates on a **hyperlocal delivery model** where outlets are set up in customer pin-code areas. Orders are routed to the nearest outlet and fulfilled within 10–15 minutes. Hence, understanding **store-level performance, item categories, and outlet types** is critical for business growth.

## 🎯 Key KPIs  
- **Average Sales per Order**  
- **Total Items Sold**  
- **Average Rating**  
- **Total Sales by Store/Location**

## 🔍 Detailed Business Requirements  
- **Total Sales by Fat Content** → Compared low fat vs. regular items in terms of sales, average sales, items sold, and average ratings.  
- **Total Sales by Item Type** → Analyzed product categories to find top-performing and underperforming items.  
- **Total Sales by Fat Content & Outlet** → Measured how fat content drives sales across different outlets.  
- **Total Sales by Outlet Establishment Year** → Checked how old vs. newly established outlets perform.  
- **Percentage Sales by Outlet Size** → Compared medium, tier-1, and tier-2 outlets.  
- **Total Sales by Outlet Location Type** → Evaluated geographical performance of outlets.  
- **Total Sales by Outlet Type** → Compared supermarkets, grocery stores, etc., in terms of revenue, sales, and ratings.
